# Erste-Sterne
This is also the secondary download if spacedock is broken

Only 0.3 and above.

This mod replaces the stock Kerbol with a dying system that takes place in the early universe which revolves around Might along with its far companion Forever, along with all of its special quirks, including mostly Duna sized terrestrial planets, smol gas planets and more. This is also a my first mod from a VERY long time so expect the quality to not be the best thing in the universe tho i've tried to be my best. Erste Sterne is NOT career/science ready and you should not start a science/career save using this mod.
